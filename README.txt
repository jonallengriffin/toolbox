toolbox
-------

a place to find Mozilla software tools

Other useful things:
* smart bookmarks
* code snippets

Testing
-------

To run in testing mode, cd to the toolbox directory and run::

 python factory.py

This will run a primitive wsgiref server on port 8080.

Improve instructions to come! :)


TODO
----

* add a view to upload new tools
* setup.py scraper
* AMO scraper
* URLs in the description should be made links
