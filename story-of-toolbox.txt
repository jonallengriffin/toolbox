The Story of Toolbox
====================

Toolbox is fundamentally a document-oriented approach to information
indexing.  A "tool" consists three mandatory string fields (name,
description, and URL) that are generic to a large class of problems as
well as classifiers, such as author, usage, type, etc. A tool may have
an arbitrary number of classifier fields as needed.  Each classifier
consists of a set of values with which a tool is tagged. This gives
toolbox the flexibility to fit a large number of data models, such as
PYPI, DOAP, and others.


Architecture
------------

Toolbox uses a fairly simple architecture with a single abstract data
model allowing an arbitrary number of implementations to be constructed::

 Interfaces            Implementations

 +----+              +-+-----+
 |HTTP|              | |files|
 +----+---\  +-----+ | +-----+
           |-|model|-+-+-----+
 +------+-/  +-----+ | |couch|
 |script|            | +-----+
 +------+            +-+---+
                     | |SQL|
                     | +---+
                     +-+---+
                       |...|
                       +---+

Toolbox was originally intended to use a directory of files, one per project,
as the backend. These were originally intended to be HTML files as the
above model may be clearly mapped as HTML::

 <div class="project"><h1><a href="{{url}}">{{name}}</a></h1>
 <p class="description">{{description}}</p>
 {{for field in fields}}
  <ul class="{{field}}">
  {{for value in values[field]}}
   <li>{{value}}</li>
  {{endfor}}
 {{endfor}}
 </div>

This microformat approach allows not only easy editing of the HTML
documents, but the documents may be indepently served and displayed
without the toolbox server-side.

User Interaction
----------------

A user will typically interact with Toolbox through the AJAX web
interface.  The server side returns relatively simple (HTML) markup,
but structured in such a way that JavaScript may be utilized to
promote rich interaction.
