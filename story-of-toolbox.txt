The Story of Toolbox
====================

Toolbox is fundamentally a document-oriented approach to resource
indexing.  A "tool" consists three mandatory string fields (name,
description, and URL) that are generic to a large class of problems as
well as classifiers, such as author, usage, type, etc. A tool may have
an arbitrary number of classifier fields as needed.  Each classifier
consists of a set of values with which a tool is tagged. This gives
toolbox the flexibility to fit a large number of data models, such as
PYPI, DOAP, and others.


Architecture
------------

Toolbox uses a fairly simple architecture with a single abstract data
model allowing an arbitrary number of implementations to be constructed::

 Interfaces            Implementations

 +----+              +-+-----+
 |HTTP|              | |files|
 +----+---\  +-----+ | +-----+
           |-|model|-+-+-----+
 +------+-/  +-----+ | |couch|
 |script|            | +-----+
 +------+            +-+---+
                     | |SQL|
                     | +---+
                     +-+---+
                       |...|
                       +---+

Toolbox was originally intended to use a directory of files, one per project,
as the backend. These were originally intended to be HTML files as the
above model may be clearly mapped as HTML::

 <div class="project"><h1><a href="{{url}}">{{name}}</a></h1>
 <p class="description">{{description}}</p>
 {{for field in fields}}
  <ul class="{{field}}">
  {{for value in values[field]}}
   <li>{{value}}</li>
  {{endfor}}
 {{endfor}}
 </div>

This microformat approach allows not only easy editing of the HTML
documents, but the documents may be indepently served and displayed
without the toolbox server-side. 

The HTML microformat was never implemented (though, since the model
backend is pluggable, it easily could be). Instead, the original
implementation used JSON blobs stored in one file per tool. This
approach loses the displayable aspect, though since JSON is a defined
format with several good tools for exploring and manipulating the data
perhaps this disavantage is offset.

A couch backend was also written.

      +------------+-----------+------------+
      |Displayable?|File-based?|Concurrency?|
+-----+------------+-----------+------------+
|HTML |Yes         |Yes        |No          |
+-----+------------+-----------+------------+
|JSON |Not really  |Yes        |No          |
+-----+------------+-----------+------------+
|Couch|No          |No         |Yes?        |
+-----+------------+-----------+------------+

The concurrency issue with file-based documennt backends may be
overcome by using locked files.  Ideally, this is accomplished at the
filesystem level.  If your filesystem does not promote this
functionality, it may be introduced programmatically.  A rough cartoon
of a good implementation is as follows:

1. A worker thread is spawned to write the data asynchronously. The
data is sent to the worker thread.

2. The worker checks for the presence of a lockfile (herein further
detailed). If the lockfile exists and is owned by an active process,
the worker waits until said process is done with it. (For a more
robust implementation, the worker sends a request to write the file to
some controller.)

3. The worker owns a lockfile based on its PID in some directory
parallel to the directory root under consideration (for example,
``/tmp/toolbox/lock/${PID}-${filename}.lck``).

4. The worker writes to the file.

5. The worker removes the lock

The toolbox web service uses a dispatcher->handler framework.  The
handlers are loosely pluggable (they are assigned in the dispatcher),
but could (and probably should) be made completely pluggable.  That
said, the toolbox web system features an integration of templates,
static resources (javascript, css, images), and handlers, so true
pluggability is further away than just supporting pluggable handlers
in the dispatcher.

Deployment, however, may be tailored as desired.  Any of the given
templates may be overridden via passing a ``template_dir`` parameter
with a path to a directory that have templates of the appropriate
names as found in toolbox's ``templates`` directory. 

Likewise, the static files (css, js, etc.) are served using ``paste``'s 
``StaticURLParser`` out of toolbox's ``static`` directory. (See
toolbox's ``factory.py``.) Notably this is *not* done using the WSGI
app itself.  Doing it with middleware allows the deployment to be
customizable by writing your own factory.  For example, instead of
using the ``paste`` webserver and the included ``paste.ini``, you
could use nginx or apache and ``mod_wsgi`` with a factory file
invoking ``Dispatcher`` with the desired arguments and serving the
static files with an arbitrary static file server.

It is common sense, if rarely followed, that deployment should be
simple.  If you want to get toolbox running on your desktop and/or for
testing, you should be able to do this easily (see the ``INSTALL.sh``
for a simple installation using ``bash``; you'll probably want to
perform these steps by hand for any sort of real-world deployment).
If you want a highly customized deployment, then this will require
more expertise and manual setup.


User Interaction
----------------

A user will typically interact with Toolbox through the AJAX web
interface.  The server side returns relatively simple (HTML) markup,
but structured in such a way that JavaScript may be utilized to
promote rich interaction.

What Toolbox Doesn't Do
-----------------------

* versioning: toolbox exposes editing towards a canonical document.
  It doesn't do versioning.  A model instance may do whatever
  versioning it desires, and since the models are pluggable, it would
  be relatively painless to subclass e.g. the file-based model and
  have a post-save hook which does an e.g. ``hg commit``. Customized
  templates could be used to display this information.

* authentication: the information presented by toolbox is freely
  readable and editable. This is by intention, as by going to a "wiki"
  model and presenting a easy to use, context-switching-free interface
  curation is encouraged (ignoring the possibly imaginary problem of
  wiki-spam). Access-level auth could be implemented using WSGI
  middleware (e.g. repoze.who or bitsyauth) or through a front end
  "webserver" integration layer such as Apache or nginx. Finer grained
  control of the presentation layer could be realized by using custom
  templates.



Evolution
---------

Often, a piece software is presented as a state out of context (that
is minus the evolution which led it to be and led it to look further
out towards beyond the horizon).  While this is an interesting special
effect for an art project, software being communication this 
is only conducive to software in the darkest of black-box approaches.

"Beers are like web frameworks: if they're not micro, you don't know
what you're talking about."

For sites that fit the architecture of a given framework, it may be
advisable to make use of them.  However, for most webapp/webservice
categories which have a finite scope and definitive intent, it is
often easier, more maintainable, and more legible to build a complete
HTTP->WSGI->app architecture than to try to hammer a framework into
fitting your problem or redefining the problem to fit the framework.
This approach was used for toolbox.

The GenshiView template, http://k0s.org/hg/GenshiView, was invoked to
generate a basic dispatcher->handler system.  The cruft was removed,
leaving only the basic structure and the TempitaHandler since tempita
is lightweight and it was envisioned that filesystem tempita templates
(MakeItSo!) would be used elsewhere in the project.
